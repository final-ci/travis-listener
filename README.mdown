# Travis Listener
**************************

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/final-ci/travis-listener.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/final-ci/travis-listener)

Travis Listener is a small Sinatra app which receives service hook notifications from GitHub and queues them for processing by Travis Gatekeeper (a private repo) using [Sidekiq](http://sidekiq.org).

Although the Travis service hook listens for several different events when activated for a repository, currently Travis Listener only processes `push` and `pull_request` events and discards the rest.

This is the first point of entry for build events from GitHub, and over time support for responding to user sync related events is planned.
